## 2026-09-21 — Focused media retest passed; reliability/UX implementation

- Founder reported all three corrected `62e3cec` APK retests passed: video centering, playback/close/background stability, and Hire attachment Review/Back/submit/readback.
- Live main at audit: `debd1995ce5f599549d16ea932a04e639b1f411d`; implementation builds on PR #102's `d26d7abb14417f4d0bb4811fdeb1d929fe41625c` source.
- New reliability/UX work: shared protected refresh for request/status/safety screens; all active requests; authorized live Search; icon navigation; native Invite Friend; distinct registration; server-backed, explicitly reviewed AI suggestions with manual fallback.
- The audited provider-only account has no verified residence; the other account is a verified resident/provider/moderator. Existing account roles and memberships remain unchanged.
- Live AI configuration, Preview deployment/readback, current CI/review and a new native acceptance pass remain gates. No additional APK has been built or authorized.
- See `docs/VC_RELIABILITY_UX.md` for findings, file/test mapping, configuration and the two-device test plan. This entry supersedes stale earlier current-state/next-action statements.

## 2026-09-18 — Media cleanup and Preview service verification

This checkpoint supersedes earlier media deployment/cleanup status.

- Draft PR #102 now adds durable Storage API cleanup for removal/replacement, failed or abandoned uploads, deleted parents, and deleted profiles. A worker authenticated by expiring, single-use tickets runs every five minutes; failures retry under leased queue entries.
- Preview `opeojxwkwwnnncnsuaag` received the foundation, cleanup, and scheduling migrations plus `process-media` and `cleanup-media`. Repository migration filenames match the versions recorded by deployment; remote history was preserved.
- All 22 authenticated HTTP assertions passed with fictional media and two temporary identities: upload, retry, processing, metadata removal, parent attachment, cross-account denial, malformed input, immediate read denial after removal, and worker authentication.
- Storage API cleanup completed eight jobs covering four stored objects; no test objects remained. Only fixture job eligibility was accelerated. The real signed-upload/processing retention windows remain intact.
- Temporary accounts, profiles, neighborhood and post were removed. `shared_media_uploads` is off. Delayed deletion receipts remain to catch any late signed PUTs.
- Local checks: 75 mobile suites / 376 tests; six server/PostgreSQL tests; TypeScript and Deno passed. Lint has zero errors and 15 baseline warnings. Latest PR CI remains the merge gate.
- Product screens remain disconnected. No APK was built. Next: review this checkpoint and its CI, then integrate one surface with parent-submit retry/text-preservation tests. Maximum-size/low-end-device performance and native picker/playback/cache behavior remain acceptance gates.
- Evidence: `docs/VC_MEDIA_PREVIEW_VERIFICATION.md` and `docs/evidence/media-preview-2026-09-18.json`.

## 2026-09-18 — Approved media foundation published in draft PR #102

This checkpoint supersedes older next-action statements below.

- The founder explicitly adopted the uploaded VC media directive in chat and approved publishing the shared-media foundation to `pushee-io/My-Corner-Trusted-People` in PR #102. The earlier authorization block is resolved; do not request this approval again.
- Baseline main: `debd1995ce5f599549d16ea932a04e639b1f411d`. Active branch: `codex/vc-media-foundation`; PR #102 remains draft pending foundation review and CI.
- Published foundation commit: `f17ad80f8e00c443b4afb35b266e96cbe9654d01`; verified tree `f609578292a7db1da509125035ed595f78780888` matches the reviewed local implementation. It includes private media upload/attachment policies, JPEG/MP4 processing, native controls, account-transition guards and tests. Product-surface integration is pending.
- Local verification: 74 mobile suites / 374 tests and five server/SQL tests passed; TypeScript, Deno, formatting, web export and Expo Doctor 18/18 passed. Lint: zero errors / 15 baseline warnings.
- Remote Mobile, Database and Media Functions workflows run on the PR. Check the latest PR head for authoritative results before merging; publication alone does not close technical gates. Storage cleanup, complete Supabase service verification and native media acceptance remain open in `docs/VC_MEDIA_CHECKPOINT_A_REVIEW.md`.
- No media deployment, flag activation or new APK is part of this publication. Paid EAS builds and production require separate approval.

## 2026-09-08 — Job Safety key configuration checkpoint

- The three pending provider-account, active-provider assignment, and job-report migrations are verified in Preview. Existing account links and roles are preserved.
- The internal Job Safety key helper now supports a named Supabase Vault secret when the existing server setting is absent. Existing configured keys retain precedence, and a missing or invalid key still fails closed.
- Founder-approved Preview key provisioning and a fresh-transaction AES-256 round trip passed. Client roles remain denied direct access to the helper and decrypted Vault values. No key values are present in this repository.
- The supporting migration only enables key lookup; it does not create or rotate secrets. The repository migration version matches the deployment record.
- Added isolated SQL coverage for missing configuration, Vault fallback, encryption/decryption, existing-setting precedence, invalid settings, and client denial. Database CI results are recorded on this repair PR.
- The installed Android build remains usable. Native fictional moderator sign-in and the complete requester/provider/moderator interaction are still pending.

Earlier checkpoints follow; this status supersedes their pending migration and encryption-configuration gates.

## 2026-09-08 — Android launch and provider-account guard checkpoint

- The approved Android Preview APK is installed on the emulator and physical phone; installed artifact identity matches on both.
- Both devices report successful starts of the app's explicit launcher activity. The emulator reused an existing activity; the phone completed a cold launch. Visible-screen confirmation and the full native requester/provider/moderator flow remain pending.
- Pending provider-test reconciliation now locks and checks the destination before detaching any account. It skips occupied destinations and non-provider source/destination roles while preserving existing access.
- SQL regression cases cover occupied moderator/provider destinations, unlinked non-provider destinations, non-provider source accounts, successful reconciliation, audit behavior, and repeated application. Database CI verifies the complete SQL/RLS suite; consult this repair PR's check results.
- Typecheck passes. Lint has zero errors and 15 existing warnings on the unchanged mobile tree.
- Preview migration deployment, fictional moderator readiness, and private-location encryption configuration remain prerequisites for native acceptance. Repository CI and device launch receipts do not establish live backend readiness.
- The existing approved APK remains the application test artifact because this repair changes SQL, tests, and documentation only. No additional Android build was submitted.

Earlier checkpoints follow; the current status above supersedes conflicting historical next actions.

## 2026-09-08 — Job report review repair checkpoint

- Requester reporting, moderator review, audit history and requester outcomes are connected in the focused repair branch.
- Local mobile verification passes: 68 suites / 329 tests, typecheck, formatting, and lint with zero errors / 15 existing warnings.
- Application, database/RLS, and existing browser usability CI passed on application commit `50b4df5` in PR #97. Expo Doctor passed 18/18 checks.
- Native two-device acceptance remains pending; no new Android build was started.
- See `docs/ANDROID_JOB_SAFETY_MODERATION_VERIFICATION.md` for checkpoint status.

## Verified Defect And Repair

Device evidence proved the provider account could read the canonical Kwame PipeCare seed request while a new requester submission was absent. The requester had used a retired duplicate Kwame provider UUID cached before PR #91.

PR #94 now enforces two boundaries:

- PostgreSQL rejects requester inserts unless the provider profile is currently accepting requests.
- Current mobile source checks provider availability before submission and tells the requester to refresh stale provider results.

The existing unreachable request was preserved and was not silently reassigned.

## Exact Next Action

1. Requester cancels the unreachable “Leaking pipes in the bathroom” test request.
2. Requester fully closes and reopens My Corner to clear the cached provider result.
3. Requester selects Kwame PipeCare again and submits one replacement titled “Bathroom pipe retest.”
4. Provider fully closes and reopens My Corner once.
5. Provider confirms the request appears, accepts or declines, and requester verifies the persisted status.

## Known Gates

- The single paid Android Preview build authorization is consumed; do not submit another paid build without founder approval.
- The installed APK predates the later client refresh and validation code, so full close/reopen remains necessary for this test.
- Do not deploy to production or activate real SMS, push, identity, residence, address-provider, or sensitive-data processing.
- Production database state remains unverified.
